# Models
A **system** is an integrated whole made up of components that are related to one another and inﬂuence each other in such a way that they can be perceived as a single, task-based or purpose-based unit. Examples of systems are material things, such as cars or airplanes, ecological environments, such as lakes and forests, but also organizational units such as a university or a company. In information technology, we are interested in particular in software systems and thus in models that describe software systems.

**Models** allow us to describe systems efﬁciently and elegantly. **Modeling languages** demonstrate clearly deﬁned rules for a structured description of a system.

In 1973, Herbert Stachowiak proposed a model theory that is distinguished by three characteristics:
1. Mapping: a model is always an image (mapping) of something, a representation of natural or artiﬁcial originals that can be models themselves.
2. Reduction: a model does not capture all attributes of the original, rather only those that seem relevant to the modeler or user of the model.
3. Pragmatism: pragmatism means orientation toward usefulness. A model is assigned to an original based on the following questions: For whom? Why? What for? A model is used by the modeler or user instead of the original within a speciﬁc time frame and for a speciﬁc purpose.

Models can be used for various purposes **Descriptive models** show a part of the reality to make a speciﬁc aspect easier to understand. For example, a city map describes a city in such a way as to help a non-local person to ﬁnd routes within the city. In contrast, **prescriptive models** are used to offer a construction manual for the system to be developed.[^classroom]
