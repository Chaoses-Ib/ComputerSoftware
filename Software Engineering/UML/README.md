# Unified Modeling Language
The **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** is a general-purpose, developmental modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.[^wiki]

## Diagrams
In UML, a model is represented graphically in the form of **diagrams**. A diagram provides a view of that part of reality described by the model.[^classroom]

Diagrams:
- Structure diagrams
  - Class diagram
  - Object diagram
  - Package diagram
  - Component diagram
  - Composition structure diagram
  - Deployment diagram
  - Profile diagram
- Behavior diagrams
  - Use case diagram
  - State machine diagram
  - Activity diagram
  - Interaction diagrams
    - Sequence diagram
    - Communication diagram
    - Timing diagram
    - Interaction overview diagram

[List of Unified Modeling Language tools - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unified_Modeling_Language_tools)

### Textual
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml))

  Open-source tool that uses simple textual descriptions to draw beautiful UML diagrams.

  Can be integrated with: Chrome, Word, Open Office, Google Docs, J2EE Servlet, JQuery, Sublime, Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ, LaTeX, Emacs, Doxygen, etc.
- [yUML](https://yuml.me/)
- [nomnoml](https://www.nomnoml.com/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/skanaar/nomnoml))
- [TextUML Toolkit](https://abstratt.github.io/textuml/index.html) ([GitHub](https://github.com/abstratt/textuml))
- [ZenUML](https://www.zenuml.com/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/ZenUml))

General:
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid))

  JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz))

Programming-language-based:
- [Umple](https://cruise.umple.org/umple/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/umple/umple))

  Umple is a _modeling tool_ and _programming language family_ to enable what we call Model-Oriented Programming. It adds abstractions such as Associations, Attributes and State Machines derived from UML to object-oriented programming languages such as Java, C++, PHP and Ruby. Umple can also be used to create UML class and state diagrams textually.
- [UMLGraph](https://www.spinellis.gr/umlgraph/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/dspinellis/UMLGraph))

  UMLGraph allows the declarative specification and drawing of UML class and sequence diagrams.

- Microsoft Visio
- Microsoft Visual Studio
  - [Class Designer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/class-designer/designing-and-viewing-classes-and-types)
