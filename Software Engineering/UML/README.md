# Unified Modeling Language
The **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** is a general-purpose, developmental modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.[^wiki]

## Diagrams
In UML, a model is represented graphically in the form of **diagrams**. A diagram provides a view of that part of reality described by the model.[^classroom]

Diagrams:
- Structure diagrams
  - Class diagram
  - Object diagram
  - Package diagram
  - Component diagram
  - Composition structure diagram
  - Deployment diagram
  - Profile diagram
- Behavior diagrams
  - Use case diagram
  - State machine diagram
  - Activity diagram
  - Interaction diagrams
    - Sequence diagram
    - Communication diagram
    - Timing diagram
    - Interaction overview diagram
