# [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
Design patterns had originally been categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on what kind of problem they solve:
- **Creational patterns** provide the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way.
- **Structural patterns** are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.
- **Behavioral patterns** are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns.

## Criticism
> Patterns mean "I have run out of language."[^rich]

> It has been observed that design patterns may just be a sign that some features are missing in a given programming language (Java or C++ for instance). Peter Norvig demonstrates that 16 out of the 23 patterns in the Design Patterns book (which is primarily focused on C++) are simplified or eliminated (via direct language support) in Lisp or Dylan. Related observations were made by Hannemann and Kiczales who implemented several of the 23 design patterns using an aspect-oriented programming language (AspectJ) and showed that code-level dependencies were removed from the implementations of 17 of the 23 design patterns and that aspect-oriented programming could simplify the implementations of design patterns.
