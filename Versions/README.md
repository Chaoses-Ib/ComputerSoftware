# Version Control
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)

> **Version control** (also known as **revision control**, **source control**, and **source code management**) is the software engineering practice of controlling computer files and versions of files; primarily source code text files, but generally any type of file.

> A version control system is a software tool that automates version control. Alternatively, version control is embedded as a feature of some systems such as word processors, spreadsheets, collaborative web docs, and content management systems, e.g., Wikipedia's page history.
