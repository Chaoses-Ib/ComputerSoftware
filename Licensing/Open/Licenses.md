## Permisive
- [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

  > The MIT License is short and to the point. It lets people do almost anything they want with your project, like making and distributing closed source versions.

- [Apache 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/)

[Apache vs MIT License Comparison - SOOS](https://soos.io/apache-vs-mit-license)
> The Apache 2.0 license is a permissive license that is somewhat similar to the MIT license. The main difference is that the Apache license includes more specific rules governing its use and any derivatives. The Apache license is much more challenging to read for the average person because it consists of a lot of legal jargon, and it’s also much longer than the MIT license’s three paragraphs.
> 
> Like the MIT license, Apache 2.0 allows code to be reused and modified by developers, including for monetary gain, and states that the original author must be referenced and cannot be held legally liable. However, the precise language used in the Apache license places more rules and restrictions than the MIT license on how its content can be used. The Apache license also states that users do not have the right to use any trademarks owned by its creator.
>
> The Apache 2.0 license requires that any significant modification of code under this license must be described. The actual modified code doesn’t have to be released, but the changes must be described in a notification included in any released derivations.
>
> A benefit that Apache 2.0 licenses have over MIT licenses is that developers can claim patents on derivative projects. The language allowing patent right transference clearly specifies the terms that some users — and lawyers — appreciate because the degree of legal protection provided minimizes the risk of potential lawsuits.

[licensing - What are the practical differences between MIT, Apache and BSD licenses? - Open Source Stack Exchange](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/what-are-the-practical-differences-between-mit-apache-and-bsd-licenses)
> The MIT and BSD 2 clause licenses have similar requirements: keep the license file. The BSD 3 clause license adds a term to the BSD 2 that prevents someone from claiming false endorsement. These three licenses are compatible with GPLv2 and v3.
> 
> The Apache 2.0 license requires you to keep the license file, the NOTICE file if there is one, and show notice for modified files. It also addresses some patent-related issues, so companies use it a lot. It is compatible with GPLv3 but not v2 (due to the patent clauses).
> 
> There is also an old BSD license that has an clause related to advertising. Don't use it because it's not GPL compatible.
> 
> In practice, the ecosystem you are working with has a license that is used most often to begin with, and I would stick to that. For example, I would use MIT for Nodejs packages. If you are working on an application, some would recommend using the Apache 2.0 license because it covers patent issues.
