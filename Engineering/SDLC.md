# Systems Development Life Cycle
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/SDLC-Maintenance-Highlighted.png/220px-SDLC-Maintenance-Highlighted.png) [^wiki]

There are usually six stages in this cycle: requirement analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.[^wiki]

- [Brooks's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)

  > Brooks' law is an observation about software project management according to which adding more individuals to a software project that is behind schedule delays it even longer.

## [Cowboy coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding)
> Cowboy coding is software development where programmers have autonomy over the development process. This includes control of the project's schedule, languages, algorithms, tools, frameworks and coding style. Typically, little to no coordination exists with other developers or stakeholders.

## [Waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)
1. System and software requirements: captured in a product requirements document
2. Analysis: resulting in models, schema, and business rules
3. Design: resulting in the software architecture
4. Coding: the development, proving, and integration of software
5. Testing: the systematic discovery and debugging of defects
6. Operations: the installation, migration, support, and maintenance of complete systems

### [V-model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-model_(software_development))

## [Incremental model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model)
The incremental model applies the waterfall model incrementally.

The series of releases is referred to as “increments”, with each increment providing more functionality to the customers. After the first increment, a core product is delivered, which can already be used by the customer. Based on customer feedback, a plan is developed for the next increments, and modifications are made accordingly. This process continues, with increments being delivered until the complete product is delivered. The incremental philosophy is also used in the agile process model.

## Evolutionary model
### [Prototype model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping)

### [Spiral model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model)

## Water fountain model

## Component-based development model

## Formal methods model
### [Cleanroom software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanroom_software_engineering)
> The **cleanroom software engineering** process is a software development process intended to produce software with a certifiable level of reliability. The central principles are software development based on formal methods, incremental implementation under statistical quality control, and statistically sound testing.

## [Unified process model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Process)

## [Agile development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
> Agile practices include requirements discovery and solutions improvement through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams with their customer(s)/end user(s).

### [Extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming)
> **Extreme programming (XP)** is a software development methodology intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent releases in short development cycles, intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.
