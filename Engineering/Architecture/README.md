  > - Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
  > - Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
  > - Only talk to your immediate friends.

  > - The **Single-responsibility principle**: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
  > - The **Openâ€“closed principle**: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
  > - The **Liskov substitution principle**: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.
  > - The **Interface segregation principle**: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
  > - The **Dependency inversion principle**: "Depend upon abstractions, \[not\] concretions."
